# A pointer is a variable which contains a memory address.

## Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
> An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

## Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. 
> Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
