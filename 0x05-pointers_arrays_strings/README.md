#### A pointer is a variable which contains a memory address.
> Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers.
> So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps

#### Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
> An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

#### Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. 
> Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
